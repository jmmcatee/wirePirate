## wirePirate

wirePirate is a tool that was developed to both better understand the protocols that make up the Internet today and become more familiar with UNIX sockets in the C programming language.

**Running the program**

$ make
$ sudo ./wirePirate

**Flags**
-p : A flag of "p" will print the payload of each packet with the header information.
-r : A flag of "r" will print the raw packet in hex along with the header.
Both flags can be applied together (-rp or -pr).
